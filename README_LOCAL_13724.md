# Angular-Material-Demo
A demo for angular material applications, I am using this repository as an aid in my angular material training videos

Since this repository follows a set of training videos, use the various branches to get a version of the project that fits each stage. So at the end of video 1, the code will look as it does in the video-1-setup branch, and so on.
